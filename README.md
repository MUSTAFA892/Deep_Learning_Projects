## 🤖 Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains a curated collection of deep learning projects built using Python and popular libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. Each project includes its associated dataset and `.ipynb` notebook for easy exploration and reproduction.

---

### 📁 Structure

* Each folder represents an independent deep learning project.
* Projects typically include:

  * A dataset (`.csv`, `.zip`, or folder)
  * A Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) explaining the full pipeline
  * Optional output files (e.g., trained models, graphs, predictions)

### 🛠️ Setup Instructions

Before running any notebook, it is recommended to **create a virtual environment** and install all dependencies.

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MUSTAFA892/Deep-Learning-Projects.git
cd Deep-Learning-Projects
```

#### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If `requirements.txt` is not available for a specific project, check the top of the notebook for individual library imports.
